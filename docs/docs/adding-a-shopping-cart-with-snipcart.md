title: Adding a Shopping Cart with Snipcart
---

## Introductory paragraph

Snipcart is a shopping cart solution designed to be dropped neatly into any web project. Including it in your project allows any HTML you write to instantly become a "buy button" with the addition of several Snipcart-specific attributes. 

Combine it with a source of products (like a CMS or an e-commerce platform like [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/)) and a payment processer (like [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/)) to build a complete e-commerce experience for your customers.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need:

- a Gatsby site with [`gatsby-plugin-snipcart`](/packages/gatsby-plugin-snipcart/) installed
- a [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) account
- products to sell (test data is fine!)

## Installing the Plugin

What are the facts you know about the topic of this guide?

Keep paragraphs short (around 1-4 sentences). People are more likely to read
several short paragraphs instead of a huge block of text.

## Adding Products

Adding products with Snipcart involves adding a set of attributes to your HTML. 

## Example

Readers will likely use doc articles as a quick reference to look up syntax.
Articles should have a basic, real-world example that shows common use cases of its syntax.

Provide at least one example of how the task gets accomplished. A code snippet is ideal, in this format:
